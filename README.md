"# CPP-project3" 


In this project we created class in cpp.
Class "Member" which represent Social networking user. The user can follow or stop following other members, and see after how many friends he follows or how many followers he has.
In addition, the system remembers how many active members there are in the system.
A main.cpp file was added to the main program with several tests. We have added the necessary files for the main program to compile and work as explained in the body of the code. In addition, we added endpoints to make sure that the class is dealing with additional cases.
